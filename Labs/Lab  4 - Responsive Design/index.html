					<p>Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns<br>
							Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?<br>
							You're the saddest bunch I ever met<br>
							But you can bet before we're through<br>
							Mister, I'll make a man out of you<br>
							Tranquil as a forest but on fire within<br>
							Once you find your center, you are sure to win<br>
							You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot<br>
							And you haven't got a clue<br>
							Somehow I'll make a man out of you<br>
							I'm never gonna catch my breath<br>
							Say goodbye to those who knew me<br>
							Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym<br>
							This guy's got 'em scared to death<br>
							Hope he doesn't see right through me<br>
							Now I really wish that I knew how to swim<br>
							<br>
							Be a man<br>
							We must be swift as the coursing river<br>
							Be a man<br>
							With all the force of a great typhoon<br>
							Be a man<br>
							With all the strength of a raging fire<br>
							Mysterious as the dark side of the moon<br>
							<br>
							Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive<br>
							Heed my every order and you might survive<br>
							You're unsuited for the rage of war<br>
							So pack up, go home, you're through<br>
							How could I make a man out of you?<br>
							<br>
							Be a man<br>
							We must be swift as the coursing river<br>
							Be a man<br>
							With all the force of a great typhoon<br>
							Be a man<br>
							With all the strength of a raging fire<br>
							Mysterious as the dark side of the moon<br>
							<br>
							Be a man<br>
							We must be swift as the coursing river<br>
							Be a man<br>
							With all the force of a great typhoon<br>
							Be a man<br>
							With all the strength of a raging fire<br>
							Mysterious as the dark side of the moon<br>

					<p>Aladdin: I can show you the world
							Shining, shimmering, splendid
							Tell me, princess, now when did
							You last let your heart decide?

							Aladdin: I can open your eyes
							Take you wonder by wonder
							Over, sideways and under
							On a magic carpet ride

							Aladdin: A whole new world
							A new fantastic point of view
							No one to tell us no or where to go
							Or say we're only dreaming



							Princess Jasmine: A whole new world
							A dazzling place I never knew
							But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear
							That now I'm in a whole new world with you
							Aladdin: (Now I'm in a whole new world with you)
							Princess Jasmine: Unbelievable sights
							Indescribable feelings
							Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
							Through an endless diamond sky

							Princess Jasmine: A whole new world
							Aladdin: (Don't you dare close your eyes)
							Princess Jasmine: A hundred thousand things to see
							Aladdin: (Hold your breath, it gets better)

							Princess Jasmine: I'm like a shooting star
							I've come so far
							I can't go back
							To where I used to be

							Aladdin: A whole new world
							Princess Jasmine: Every turn a surprise

							Aladdin: With new horizons to pursue
							Princess Jasmine: Every moment red letter
							Both: I'll chase them anywhere
							There's time to spare
							Let me share this whole new world with you

							Aladdin: A whole new world
							Princess Jasmine: A whole new world
							Aladdin: That's where we'll be
							Princess Jasmine: That's where we'll be
							Aladdin: A thrilling chase
							Princess Jasmine: A wondrous place
							Both: For you and me
